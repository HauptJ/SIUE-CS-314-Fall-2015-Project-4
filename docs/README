HI :)

4.1 note:
Running in the /execs directory, just run ./41run and be happy.

4.2 note:
Running userprog1 and userprog2 directly (eg, dlxsim -m 16777216 -x os.dlx.obj 
-a -u userprog2.dlx.obj) returns the correct output. However, we were unable to
run userprog.dlx.obj with a numbered parameter, as it failed to recognize the
input.
